    Dm                    Am
You think I'm an ignorant sexist
        Dm
And you have so many followers,
  C
I guess it must be so
    F              Am
But still I cannot see
       F             Am
If the savage one is me
    Dm              F         C         Am
How can there be so much that you don't know?
Am  C     Dm
You don't know ...


Am  C                                       Am
You think you own whatever content that you take from
    C                                 Em
The 'net is just a dead thing you can claim
    Am           Em               F      C
But I know every game and dev and studio
      Dm          G             Am
Has a life, has a spirit, has a name


Am  C                             Am
You think the only people who are people
        C                             Em
Are the people who act and think like you
    Am              Em             F         C
But if you walk the footsteps of a neckbeard
             Dm               G              C
You'll learn things you never knew you never knew


Em       Am                         Em         F
Have you ever heard the wolf cry as you slayed Sif?
   Am                                   Em
Or asked that dog from duck hunt why he grinned?
        F                 G                  Em   Am
Can you sing with all the dwarf forts of the mountains?
        F                  C                 G
Can you paint with all the colors of space engine?
        Dm                 F                 C
Can you paint with all the colors of space engine?


     C              G                  Am
Come make a perfect speedrun through Majora
     C                    G                   Em
Come fight with Ness when you're bound to the Earth
     Am             G             F          C
Come roll in the achievements all around you
        Dm                  G                  Am
And for once, not care what gamerscore they're worth


Am  C                         Am
The console and the pc are my brothers
    C                              Em
The shooter and the fighter are my friends
    Am         Em                F     C
And we are all connected to each other
              Dm           G              C
In a friend's circle, in a LAN that never ends


C   G         Em          Am
How high will your skills grow?
   Dm                                 G
If you complain and quit, then you'll never know


Em         Am                           Em       F
And you'll never hear the wolf cry when you slay Sif
    Am                         Em
For whether we are sane or feminist
           F                 G                  Em   Am
We need to sing with all the dwarf forts of the mountains
           F                  C                 G
We need to paint with all the colors of space engine


        Dm               G
You can own the 'net and still
           Em           F
All you'll own is ads until
        Am            Em   F   G   C
You can play any game just for the thrill
