     Am
Oh I come from a board
        B
From an immoral place
       D                Am
Where anonymous lurkers roam
           Cm
Where it's blue and intense
        D
And the bait is immense
     E                     Am
It's barbaric but hey it's home


         F
When the virgins arrive
         Am
And they shitpost and fight
         F                   E
And your keystrokes hit just right
        Am
Come on in stop on by
       B
Join a thread and reply
    E             Am
To another Friday night


          Am   Cm
Oh Friday nights
            Am Cm
Like Friday days
                Am
More often than not
      Em       Am
Are a major hotspot
    F     E
For vidya gaems


           Am   Cm
Yes Friday nights
              Am Cm
'neath Friday mods
             Am
A fool a bit late
           Em      Am
Could take obvious bait
    F        E   Am
Out there in the blue
