      F           C     Dm           Am
I see trees of green       red roses too
Gm           F      A7            Dm
  I see them bloom     for me and you
      A#               C                  F
And I think to myself    what a wonderful world


      F           C   Dm               Am
I see skies of blue      and clouds of white
Gm                   F   A7                 Dm
  The bright blessed day    the dark sacred night
      A#              C                  F
And I think to myself   what a wonderful world


    C                           F
The colours of a rainbow are so pretty in the sky
    C                    F
Are also on the faces of people going by
      Dm              Am           Dm            Am
I see friends shaking hands saying    how do you do
Dm                Am     Fsus2      C
   Theyâ€™re really saying I     love you


       F      C    Dm              Am
I hear babies cry     I watch them grow
Gm                        F      A7        Dm
  They'll learn much more   than I'll ever know
      Gm               C                  F
And I think to myself    what a wonderful world
      A#               C                  F
Yes I think to myself    what a wonderful world
