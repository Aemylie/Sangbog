E                                     F#m
I've been staring at the edge of the water
              C#m
Long as I can remember
                     A
Never really knowing why
E                             F#m
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
                       C#m
But I come back to the water
                     A
No matter how hard I try

C#m
Every turn I take, every trail I track
H
Every path I make, every road leads back
E
To the place I know, where I cannot go
        Am
Where I long to be

        E                                    H
See the line where the sky meets the sea, it calls me
       C#m              A
No one knows how far it goes
       E                                H
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             C#m
One day I'll know
     Am                                      E
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go


I know everybody on this island
Seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island
Has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me

See the light as it shines on the sea, it's blinding
But no one knows how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line


        F                                          C              
See the line where the sky meets the sea, it calls me
           Dm               Bb
And no one knows how far it goes
       F                                C
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
             Dm                 Bb  C
One day I'll know, how far I'll go
