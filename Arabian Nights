     Am
Oh I come from a land
       B
From a faraway place
      D                  Am
Where the caravan camels roam
           Cm
Where they cut off your ear
        D
If they don't like your face
     E                     Am
It's barbaric but hey it's home


         F
When the wind's from the East
        Am
And the sun's from the west
        F                    E
And the sand in the glass is right
        Am
Come on down stop on by
      B
Hop a carpet and fly
   E               Am
To another Arabian night


        Am   Cm
Arabian nights
             Am Cm
Like Arabian days
                Am
More often than not
    Em          Am
Are hotter than hot
     F           E
In a lot of good ways


        Am   Cm
Arabian nights
               Am Cm
'neath Arabian moons
               Am
A fool off his guard
      Em            Am
Could fall and fall hard
    F        E   Am
Out there in the dunes
